# Common Kotlin Collection Operations

This example demonstrates the common collection operations `map`, `filter`, and `toSet` in Kotlin.  These operations allow you to efficiently transform and filter collections.

## Usage

The `main` function shows how to apply these operations to `List`, `Map`, and `Set` collections. The `map` operation transforms each element of the collection, while the `filter` operation selects only the elements that satisfy a given condition. Finally, `toSet` converts a collection into a set, removing any duplicate elements.

## Code Example

The `CollectionOperations.kt` file contains the code demonstrating these operations. Each operation's output is printed to the console.
